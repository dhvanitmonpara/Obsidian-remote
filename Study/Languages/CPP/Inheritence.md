# Types of Inheritance in OOP

## Single Inheritance

- A class inherits from only one base class.
- Parent-child relationship is one-to-one.

## Multiple Inheritance

- A class inherits from more than one base class.
- Allows a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.

## Hierarchical Inheritance

- Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
- Forms a hierarchy where a base class is inherited by several derived classes.

## Multilevel Inheritance

- A class inherits from another class, and then a new class inherits from that derived class.
- Forms a chain of inheritance.

## Hybrid Inheritance

- Combination of multiple types of inheritance, such as single, multiple, hierarchical, or multilevel.
- Used to model complex relationships in certain scenarios.

# Syntax

```
class {{Dervied-class-name}} : {{access-modifier}} {{Base-class-name}} {

}
```

**Private class:** All the members will be private.

**Public class:** All the members will be public.

**Protected class:** All the member are private but inheritable.

In summary derived class can't access private members of base class even it defined as private. Private is default class-access.

```
// For Multiple Inheritance

class {{Dervied-class-name}} : {{access-modifier}} {{Base-class-1}}, {{access-modifier}} {{Base-class-2}} {

}
```

## Derivation table

| Derivation        | Public Derivation | Private Derivation | Protected     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Private members   | Not Inherited     | Not Inherited      | Not Inherited |
| Protected members | Protected         | Private            | Protected     |
| Public members    | Public            | Private            | Protected     |

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base Class
class Employee
{
public:
    int id;
    float salary;
    Employee(int inpId)
    {
        id = inpId;
        salary = 34.0;
    }
    Employee() {}
};

// Creating a Programmer class derived from Employee Base class
class Programmer : public Employee
{
public:
    int languageCode;
    Programmer(int inpId)
    {
        id = inpId;
        languageCode = 9;
    }
    void getData(){
        cout<<id<<endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Employee harry(1), rohan(2);
    cout << harry.salary << endl;
    cout << rohan.salary << endl;
    Programmer skillF(10);
    cout << skillF.languageCode<<endl;
    cout << skillF.id<<endl;
    skillF.getData();
    return 0;
}

```

Classes example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base
{
    int data1; // private by default and is not inheritable
public:
    int data2;
    void setData();
    int getData1();
    int getData2();
};

void Base ::setData(void)
{
    data1 = 10;
    data2 = 20;
}

int Base::getData1()
{
    return data1;
}

int Base::getData2()
{
    return data2;
}

class Derived : public Base
{ // Class is being derived publically
    int data3;

public:
    void process();
    void display();
};

void Derived ::process()
{
    data3 = data2 * getData1();
}

void Derived ::display()
{
    cout << "Value of data 1 is " << getData1() << endl;
    cout << "Value of data 2 is " << data2 << endl;
    cout << "Value of data 3 is " << data3 << endl;
}

int main()
{
    Derived der;
    der.setData();
    der.process();
    der.display();

    return 0;
}

```

# Ambiguity reslution

Ambiguity in inheritance can be defined when one class derived for two or more base classes then there are chances that the base classes have functions with the same name. so it will confuse derived class to choose from similar name functions. To solve this ambiguity scope resolution operator is used `::`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base1{
    public:
        void greet(){
            cout<<"How are you?"<<endl;
        }
};

class Base2{
    public:
        void greet()
        {
            cout << "Kaise ho?" << endl;
        }
};


class Derived : public Base1, public Base2{
   int a;
   public:
    void greet(){
        Base2 :: greet();
    }
};

int main(){
  // Ambibuity 1
     Base1 base1obj;
     Base2 base2obj;
     base1obj.greet();
     base2obj.greet();
     Derived d;
     d.greet();

    return 0;
}

class B{
    public:
        void say(){
            cout<<"Hello world"<<endl;
        }
};

class D: public B{
    int a;
    // D's new say() method will override base class's say() method
    public:
        void say()
        {
            cout << "Hello my beautiful people" << endl;
        }
};

int main(){
    // Ambibuity 2
    B b;
    b.say();

    D d;
    d.say();

    return 0;
}

```

# Virtual class

The virtual base class is a concept used in multiple inheritances to prevent ambiguity between multiple instances. For example: suppose we created a class “A” and two classes “B” and “C”, are being derived from class “A”. But once we create a class “D” which is being derived from class “B” and “C” as shown in figure 1.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A {
public:
    void say()
    {
        cout << "Hello world"<<endl;
    }
};
class B : public virtual A {
};
class C : public virtual A {
};
class D : public B, public C {
};

```

In this example, `class b` and `class c` are virtually inherited from `class a`. when a programmer inherit `class d` from `class b` and `class c`, It directly inherits from `class a`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class a
{
protected:
    int a = 10;
public:
    void func1(void)
    {
        cout << endl
             << "This is a : " << a;
    }
};

class b : virtual public a
{
public:
    void func2(void)
    {
       a = 20;
        cout << endl
             << "This is b : " << a;
    }
};

class c : virtual public a
{
public:
    void func3(void)
    {
        a = 30;
        cout << endl
             << "This is c : " << a;
    }
};

class d : public b, public c
{
public:
    void func4(void)
    {
        cout << endl
             << "This is d : " << a;
    }
};

int main()
{
    a obj1;
    b obj2;
    c obj3;
    d obj4;
  
    obj1.func1();
    obj2.func2();
    obj3.func3();
    obj4.func4();

    return 0;
}
```

# Constructors in derived class

- We can use constructors in derived classes in C++.
- If the base class constructor does not have any arguments, there is no need for any constructor in the derived class.
- But if there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor, derived class need to pass argument to the base class constructor.
- If both base and derived classes have constructors, base class constructor is executed first.



```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base1{
    int data1;
    public:
        Base1(int i){
            data1 = i;
            cout<<"Base1 class constructor called"<<endl;
        }
        void printDataBase1(void){
            cout<<"The value of data1 is "<<data1<<endl;
        }
};

class Base2{
    int data2;

    public:
        Base2(int i){
            data2 = i;
            cout << "Base2 class constructor called" << endl;
        }
        void printDataBase2(void){
            cout << "The value of data2 is " << data2 << endl;
        }
};

class Derived: public Base2, public Base1{
    int derived1, derived2;
    public:
        Derived(int a, int b, int c, int d) : Base2(b), Base1(a)
        {
            derived1 = c;
            derived2 = d;
            cout<< "Derived class constructor called"<<endl;
        }
        void printDataDerived(void)
        {
            cout << "The value of derived1 is " << derived1 << endl;
            cout << "The value of derived2 is " << derived2 << endl;
        }
};

int main(){
    Derived harry(1, 2, 3, 4);
    harry.printDataBase1();
    harry.printDataBase2();
    harry.printDataDerived();
    return 0;
}

```
